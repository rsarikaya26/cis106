# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

1. What is an Operating System?
   - An operating system (OS) is essential system software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, serving as a bridge between the user and the machine's physical components.
  
2. What is a kernel?
   - A kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system that always has complete control over everything in the system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.
  
3. Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?  
   - A kernel is the central, core component of a computer's operating system that acts as the primary interface between the software and hardware, managing system resources like the CPU, memory, and devices, and providing essential services to other programs.
  
4. What is linux and linux distribution?
    - Linux is an open-source operating system kernel, and a Linux distribution (or "distro") is a complete operating system built by combining the Linux kernel with other software like system libraries, utilities, and applications, along with a package manager to install new software

5. List at least 4 linux characteristics:
-  Open source
The source code for Linux is freely available to the public for anyone to see, modify, and distribute. This has fostered a large, global community of developers who continuously work to improve its functionality and fix bugs
-  Security
Linux systems are highly secure due to a robust permissions system and rapid, community-driven security updates. Its architecture makes it inherently less susceptible to malware and viruses than other operating systems, and it includes features like user authentication, access controls, and data encryption
-  Stability
Known for its reliability, Linux can run for extended periods without needing a reboot. This stability makes it a popular choice for mission-critical systems like servers and supercomputers, where downtime can be costly. 
-  Flexibility and customization
Linux is extremely flexible and can be customized to fit specific user needs. Users can choose from a wide variety of distributions (or "distros") that are tailored for different purposes, hardware types, and user experience levels. This includes using a graphical user interface (GUI) or a powerful command-line interface (CLI)


6.  What is Debian?
   - Debian is a stable, free and open-source Linux-based operating system developed by a global community of volunteers, known for its stability, security, and extensive package repository.
  
7.  List and define the different types of licensing agreements
   - Patent License: Grants the licensee the right to use, manufacture, sell, or import a patented invention. 
   - Trademark License: Allows the licensee to use the licensor's brand name, logo, slogan, or other brand identity on specific products or services
   - Copyright License: Permits the licensee to use copyrighted materials, such as music, software, literature, photographs, or other creative works.
   - Trade Secret License: Authorizes the use of confidential business information or proprietary knowledge not registered with the government, often requiring a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). 
8.  What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
9.  What is virtualization?
