# Programming Fundamentals with Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and large ecosystem of libraries. It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more.


## Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare a type explicitly.


### Examples of basic data types 

``` python
name = "Alice"       # string
 age = 30             # integer
 height = 1.65        # float
 is_active = True     # boolean
```

### Common data types:
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `float`: Decimal numbers
- `str`: Text (strings)
- `bool`: Boolean (True or False)
- `list`, tuple, dict, set: Collection types


## Control Flow

Python uses indentation (usually 4 spaces) to define code blocks.

### If-else statement

``` python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### Elif (else-if) example

``` python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C")
```
