# Linux
[linux]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). [Linux]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is typically packaged as a [Linux distribution]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.
